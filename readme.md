# Pre-Architecture Document for SEO Optimization Script

## Overview

This script extracts text from a webpage, generates a summary, and creates SEO-optimized headings and search terms using OpenAI's GPT-4o model. It then fetches real-time SEO keywords from SerpAPI and re-ranks the headings based on keyword optimization. Finally, it saves the results to a JSON file.

## Technology Stack

1. Python: Programming language for implementation.

2. Requests: Library for fetching webpage content.

3. BeautifulSoup: HTML parser for extracting webpage text.

4. LangChain: OpenAI API integration for text processing.

5. SerpAPI: API for fetching SEO keywords.

6. JSON: Data storage format.

7. dotenv: For managing environment variables.

## Steps in the Workflow

1️⃣ Load Environment Variables & API Keys

a) Loads API keys and configurations from a .env file.

b) Initializes the OpenAI Chat model with LangChain.

c) Sets the SerpAPI key.

2️⃣ Extract Content from Webpage

a)Uses requests to fetch the HTML content of the given URL.

b)Parses HTML using BeautifulSoup.

c)Extracts the page title and paragraph text.

d)Returns a concatenated string of extracted content.

3️⃣ Generate a Summary of the Extracted Content

a)Uses OpenAI’s LLM (GPT-4o) to summarize the article.

b)The summary is limited to 5 concise sentences highlighting key points.

4️⃣ Generate SEO-Optimized Headings

a)Uses OpenAI to generate 10 SEO-optimized headings based on the summary.

b)Ensures headings are relevant, contain keywords, and follow an H1/H2 structure.

c)Returns results in a JSON format.

5️⃣ Generate SEO Search Terms

a)Uses OpenAI to generate 10 search terms based on the article summary.

b)Outputs results in a JSON format.

6️⃣ Fetch Real-Time SEO Keywords Using SerpAPI

a)Queries SerpAPI using each search term.

b)Extracts the top 5 suggested keywords for each term.

c)Stores keyword mappings in a dictionary.

7️⃣ Re-Rank SEO Headings with Optimized Keywords

a)Uses OpenAI to refine the SEO headings using the extracted keywords.

b)Ensures that the final headings include the most optimized SEO terms.

c)Returns results in JSON format.

8️⃣ Save Final SEO Data to JSON File

a)Stores the optimized SEO headings and keywords into a JSON file.

b)Saves metadata like the processed URL.

9️⃣ Execute the Full Workflow

a)Defines a sample URL for testing.

b)Executes all the above steps in sequence.

c)Prints final SEO-optimized headings.

d)Saves the results to a file.

e)Error Handling

f)Request Failures: Catches requests.exceptions.RequestException when fetching URLs.

g)Invalid JSON Handling: Catches json.JSONDecodeError and provides fallback values.

h)API Failures: If SerpAPI fails, handles errors and continues execution.

## Expected Output

1. A summary of the article.

2. 10 SEO-optimized headings.

3. 10 SEO search terms.

4. Real-time SEO keywords for each search term.

5. A JSON file storing all results.

## Enhancements & Future Improvements

1. Allow user input for the webpage URL.

2. Implement caching to avoid repeated API calls.

3. Optimize API call limits by batching requests.

4. Support multi-language content extraction.

## Conclusion

This script automates SEO content generation using AI and real-time keyword analysis, making it highly useful for bloggers, digital marketers, and content creators.
